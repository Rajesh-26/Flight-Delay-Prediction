# Flight-Delay-Prediction

Flight delays are an important subject in the literature due to their economic and environmental impacts.
They may increase costs to customers and operational costs to airlines. Apart from outcomes directly
related to passengers, delay prediction is crucial during the decision-making process for every player in
the air transportation system.

The purpose is not to obtain the best possible prediction but rather to emphasize on the various steps
needed to build such a mode, the importance of the separation of the dataset during the training stage
and how cross-validation helps in determining accurate model parameters. It shows how to build linear
and polynomial models for univariate or multivariate regressions and also, It gives us some insight on
the reason why regularisation helps us in developing models that generalize well.

Here me made use of Regression models for prediction after performing various visualization tasks on data
